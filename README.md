Q Learning Algorithm in Lego MINDSTORMS EV3 Robots
==================================================
This code uses the Q reinforcement learning algorithm to teach a Lego MINDSTORMS EV3 Robot to learn the optimal way to react to obstacles in its environment. This program can be altered to take in input from different types of sensors, and the reward values for different states can be changed as well.

Also included is a header file which contains some basic movement functions.
